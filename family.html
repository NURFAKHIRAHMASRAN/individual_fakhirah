       <p>I am the second child of four siblings. My father was a retired soldier and my mother a housewife. I and my sister are the children of the familyâ€™s hope as our siblings are still in school. We go on vacation 2 times a year to spend time together and also strengthen family ties. While many say that this soldier's career is a "luxury" career, anyone who faces it knows the truth. If an operation took place, my father had to leave us for months and we were taken care of by my mother alone. The financial chapter can also be said to be less affordable so there are times we only eat banana chips a week to fill our stomachs. But now, there is no denying that we live fully on the services of my mother and father and I hope that I can repay their services before they "close their eyes".</p>

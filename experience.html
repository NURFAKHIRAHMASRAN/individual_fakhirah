<p>Hi and Assalamualaikum. Hope everyone is healthy and it's not too late for me to say "Happy New Year 2022". May Allah SWT always protect us from all diseases, especially the Covid-19 epidemic which is getting worse in our country.</p>
<br>
<p>My lifelong experience of these 20 years is that life must be bitter and sweet. Life taught me the true meaning of patience in facing life’s challenges. From a young age, I was cared for by both parents lovingly and when growing up, I had to learn to be independent and no longer have to expect others to help us in our own lives. Despite having life problems, try to solve them in our own way without giving up so that the pleasure of life will definitely be achieved one day.
As the saying goes, “a rainbow is a promise of sunshine after rain. Of calm after storms. Of joy after sadness. Of peace after pain. Of love after loss.”</p>
<br>
<p>I feel lucky that I had the opportunity to continue the lessons even though I wasn’t interested in them. For my experience throughout my studies, I am indeed very proud of myself because I do not think I could survive until this day. With the current pandemic situation, honestly makes it difficult for me to be enthusiastic in the classroom. I have to divide my time as a student and also at the same time as a child at home. Although I am going through difficult times at this time, but I can only be patient and continue to face only what is happening because the world in the future is more challenging.</p>

<p>When I was 7 years old, I attended primary school at SK Penghulu Ahmad, in Langkawi, Kedah. My experience during my schooling here is that I have a lot of fun but at the same time, I have to learn to be independent and brave to face people. I had just moved from Negeri Sembilan at that time due to the factor of following my family. So, at the beginning of school, it was undeniably difficult for me to survive because there were no more friends and most of them had been friends since kindergarten.</p>
<br>
<p>When I was 9 years old, I moved with my family to Penang and went to school at SK Sungai Rusa. This was my second school in elementary school. Although at this time I also have to survive alone, but I'm used to it and I show a lot of talent in myself. Among them are playing netball up to the national level, speeches, and poems. This made me quickly known among teachers as well as friends and made it easier for me to communicate at school.</p>
<br>
<p>After that, I went to secondary school at Almashoor Islamic Girls Schools in Penang. This is my favorite school. This school taught me a lot about the meaning of real-life and how to face the world of reality. Pupils are inculcated with religious practices every day making this school the best school in Penang. In this school, I got excellent results in the PT3 and SPM examinations. The school also received the cluster school award of excellence due to the school's increasing performance every year. In conclusion, this school is an excellent school because it can produce many previous figures who are a reference to this day.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, I am a final semester student at UiTM Merbok, Kedah, and studying Information Management. As long as I took my diploma at UiTM Merbok, many sweet and bitter memories will never be forgotten. Importantly, all the knowledge that I get, I will apply in daily life and while working later.</p>
